Is the result expected?
The naive GPU algorithm has the worst result, and the recursive is better than the CPU once the array is big enough.

What went well with this assignment?
The  collected result is expected base on run time complexity

What was difficult?
Understanding how to adapt double recursive function without shared memory

How would you approach it differently?
I think I might approach the algorithm without shared memory in mind in the first place

Anything else you want me to know?
Nope.
